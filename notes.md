# Course Project: Content Platform
A content platform for instructors and students, specific to learning web development.

---

## Course Specific Details

### Overview

The challenges of using Blackboard as a means of communicating information, content and grades between instructor and student has been well documented *(by me, mostly!)*. To complete the start-to-finish lifecycle of an application, we will work as a team to develop an application from planning to beta.

This project is an exercises in team-building and management, as much as it is development. The entire project (scope, execution parameters, design, development, marketing, strategy, success criteria and grading, etc), will be self-managed. 

### Goals

1. Experiencing a full application lifecycle
2. Exposure to tools and/or frameworks
3. Collaborative development

### Weekly

- New teams will be built weekly to service the project's immediate needs
- Each Monday's class will be used as a "stand up" meeting (open to format suggestions)

### Assessment

- How will we, as a class (including the instructor), keep ourselves accountable? 
- How do we assess successful completion of weekly tasks?

### Proposed Tools

- Project management: Asana, Trello, Github boards, Spreadsheet
- Devops: Github
- Development stack:
  - MERN: Mongo, Express, React, Node
  - JAM: Javascript, API, Markup
- Testing & Deployment

## Application Specific

### Problems (Instructor Perspective)

#### Blackboard
- Feature rich, but poor in demonstarting how features can be used
- Difficult to add/format content not already pre-formatted-and-compiled (ex, PDF, DOC)
  - This means content that can't easily be updated
- Code is not easily formatted (or compiled)
- Using one application for content, one for chat
- Gradebook learning curve for weighting is challenging and is not easily customizable
- Easily building and populating courses



### Problems (Student Perspective)

**What type of challenges have you encountered while learning to be a web developer at Humber College?**

- Too many online resouces that are not properly vetted
  - How good are the resources?
  - Are they good from a student's perspective, or just the instructor?
- Length of course does not match the content/skillset required
  - More time on development
- More development work and combine "design" into one course per term
  - Project planning course should be more related to web development
  - Overlapping content, should be one course
  - Design aspects should be more related to web development
  - Information architecture not fully covered
  - Adobe XD vs Photoshop, consistency of tools or more of a linear pathway
  - Better defining "framework"
- Better understand of market expectations
- Crossover between classes needs more work
- Communication, not using tools provided (Blackboard) and instead using Slack or other to manage
- Feedback (is it suffucient, can it better)
- Expectations are not necessarily clear
- Provide a bundle/script of software or setting

### Questions/Parameters
- Should it be specific to web development?
- Is CMS (generalizing) important?
- Is security a concern?

### Next Steps
- Develop a project name (can be temp)
- Setup repository
- Create a Slack channel (or shall we exclusively use Github Issues?)
- Determine weekly outlook
- Assign first tasks
